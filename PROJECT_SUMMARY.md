# Lisp Windows Toolkit - Project summary

Author: Nicholas Cole Akers

This project provides a Windows-friendly Common Lisp development setup with automated scripts, documentation, and tests.

## Problem and solution

Windows users often face friction setting up Common Lisp (PATH, implementations, Quicklisp, ASDF). This toolkit offers a scripted setup, example project, and guidance to reduce that friction.

## Components

- PowerShell scripts for setup and common tasks
- Roswell, SBCL, Quicklisp integration
- ASDF system and example source
- Test runner and coverage on SBCL
- Documentation for beginners and contributors

## Technical notes

- Uses Roswell to manage implementations (SBCL by default)
- FiveAM for tests; sb-cover for coverage (SBCL)
- GitHub Actions workflow for Windows CI

## Roadmap (suggested)

- Broaden test coverage and examples
- Add guidance for other Lisp implementations (CCL, ECL, ABCL)
- Optional Linux/macOS notes
- Editor integrations and tips

## Note on LLM assistance

Some documentation, scripts, and tests were authored or refined with AI assistance and then reviewed and edited by the maintainers.
